what I understand fom the assignment.
Step 1: Setting Up Choices

We have a game where you can pick either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will also make a choice.

Step 2: Play a Round

When you pick something and the computer picks something, we decide who wins. If you pick the same thing as the computer, it's a tie. If you pick Rock and the computer picks Scissors, you win! If you pick Paper and the computer picks Rock, you also win! If you pick Scissors and the computer picks Paper, you win again! But if the computer picks something that beats what you picked, you lose.

Step 3: Typing Animation

At the beginning of the game, I want to show a cool typing animation on the screen. It will write a sentence to get you excited about the game.

Step 4: Game Start

We start the game by making the typing animation happen. Then, we wait a little bit before we start the real game.

Step 5: Celebration

If you win the game by getting 5 points, we want to show a celebration animation to make you feel awesome.

Step 6: Playing the Game

When you click on a picture (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), the game starts. We figure out who wins that round and show the result on the screen. If you win and get 5 points, we show the celebration animation!

Step 7: Event Listeners

We listen for when you click on the pictures. When you click on one, we start playing the game and figure out if you win or not.

Step 8: Starting the Game

When the page loads (when you open the game), we start the typing animation to get you excited.

So, the code is like a recipe for the computer to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with you. It shows cool animations, keeps track of the scores, and celebrates when you win!





To get started with the Rock Paper Scissors game, these are the steps I followed:

Created a Git repo for my project 
created a blank HTML document with an external JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) linked to it.

Defined a function called getComputerChoice() that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors' as the computer's play.

Wrote a function called playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. This function will take the player's selection (case-insensitive) and the computer's selection as parameters and return a string that declares the winner of the round.

Created a new function, game() that will play a 5 round game, keep score, and report the winner or loser at the end. This function will call the playRound() function five times in a row.

Used console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end. You can use prompt() to get input from the user for their selection.
